# raytracing-rust
Implementation of Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" in the Rust language.

![This came from the book](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1danielcoelho/raytracing-rust/master/from_the_book.png "This is from the book, rendering this single threaded would probably take a calendar month")

I tried to make it as idiomatic as possible. Takes hours to render a single image as it is single-threaded (so far!)

# TODO:
* Multithreading
* Replace my Vec3 implementation with something like cgmath
